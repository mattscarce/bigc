Install python https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/?msclkid=c742f580c2ee11eca38f3dd6bd415dc4&adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=B91076AAC89C4BB8B6DF106FE1E0499A

run the install.bat (you only need to do this if its your fist time)

run sharebot.bat NOT main.py because that wont work

you can check the .bat for any viruses if you are suspicious

If the install does not work and says "pip is not recognised as an interal
 or external batch program"

go into command prompt and type "python -m pip install pip" and restart your computer
